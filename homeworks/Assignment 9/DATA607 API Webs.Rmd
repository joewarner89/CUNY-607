## New York Times Books API
I choose the book api from New York Times that contains information 15 books. 
First we use a API Tester to see all the revelant information about the API and what I can get a view where to get the information I need. I need to contruct a table from API available information. 

![Thi is API tester from Chrome](C:\Users\Warner_Beast\OneDrive\Documents\CUNY\DATA 607 - Data Acquisition and Management\HomeWork\Assignment 9\Screenshot.png)




```{r cars}
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(lares)
library(ggplot2)
library(httr)
library(ggbump)
# Read the api links 
api_url <- "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/lists/current/hardcover-fiction.json?api-key=QFqxixdrjHITcbZo0Q4gU1pHEUQSWu11"

# turn the data into Json Format
data <- fromJSON(api_url)

# based on the API test, select books from the jSon format 
books  <- as.data.frame( data$results$books)
```

Lets investigate the Book data set. 

```{r pressure}
str(books)
# Show preview some columns 
head(books) %>% select(6:8,11)
```
Lets look at the books that spend more times in the list for highest ranking books


```{r}
ggplot(books, aes(x = title, y = weeks_on_list)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = title, xend = title, y = 0, yend = weeks_on_list),
               color = "gray", lwd = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 7.5, pch = 21, bg = 4, col = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(label = weeks_on_list), color = "white", size = 3) +
  #scale_x_discrete(labels = paste0("G_", 1:10)) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```



## Conclusion
This graph shows a distribution of all the books that spend weeks in the ranking chart. I access the API from NYTimes Developer account and turn the json data into a R Data Frame and run analysis on it.
